# Security Policy

## Is Poku Safe?

**Poku** is an open-source project, so you can see both the [Source Code on **GitHub** Repository](https://github.com/wellwelwel/docker) and the [Distribution Code on **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pokujs/docker?activeTab=code).

---

### Why does Poku use `child_process`?

**@pokujs/docker** starts a background process for each container initialized and handles its starting and ending.

---

### Protective Measures

- Prevents shell scripts by setting `shell` to `false` in **`spawn`** options, ensuring that only secure arguments will be used.
- Every **RegExp** is prev-tested using the [**ReDoS Checker**](https://devina.io/redos-checker).

---

## Supported Versions

Currently, security updates will be applied to the following versions of **Poku**:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                |
